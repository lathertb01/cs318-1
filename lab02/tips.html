     Travel can be stressful, for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be preempted. Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you should do these things:
      
        <p>
      <li>Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while you're gone.</li>
      <li>Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase gets lost, your mouth feels it first.</li>
      <li>Get a dragon sitter. Your pet may seem aloof when you're around, but the minute you leave, it will start crying, loudly.</li>
      </p>
