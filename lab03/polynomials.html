        If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:
     </p> 
     <ul>
        Constant 
        <blockquote>Constant polynomials have the form a .</blockquote>
        Linear
        <blockquote>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x + b.</blockquote>
        Quadratic
        <blockquote> Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup2;+ b &times; x + c .</blockquote>
        Cubic
        <blockquote>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup3;+ b &times; x&sup2; + c &times; x + d.</blockquote>
        </ul>
